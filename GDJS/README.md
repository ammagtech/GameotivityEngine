## 2) Development ðŸ¤“

GDJS is composed of two parts:

- the JavaScript game engine (_Runtime_ folder), called _GDJS Runtime_.
- the C++ part exposing GDJS to GDevelop IDE (_GDJS_ folder), including the Exporter and classes doing transpilation from events to JavaScript, called _GDJS Platform_.

### GDJS Runtime (game engine)

The game engine is in the _Runtime_ folder. If you want to work on the engine directly, follow the [GDevelop 5 README about the development of the game engine](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop/blob/master/newIDE/README.md#development-of-the-game-engine).

- To use the game engine, you can look into the **[GDJS Runtime (game engine) documentation](https://docs.gdevelop.io/GDJS%20Runtime%20Documentation)**.

- To run tests for the game engine, go to `GDJS/tests`, run `npm install` and `npm test`. More information in the [README for the tests](https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop/tree/master/GDJS/tests).

- To launch type checking with TypeScript, run `npm install` and `npm run check-types` in `GDJS` folder.
