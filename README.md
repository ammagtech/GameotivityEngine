| `Core`        | Core classes, describing the structure of a game and tools to implement the IDE and work with games.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `GDJS`        | The game engine, written in TypeScript, using PixiJS and Three.js for 2D and 3D rendering (WebGL), powering all  games.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `GDevelop.js` | Bindings of `Core`, `GDJS` and `Extensions` to JavaScript (with WebAssembly), used by the IDE.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `newIDE`      | The game editor, written in JavaScript with React, Electron, PixiJS and Three.js.js.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `Extensions`  | Built-in extensions for the game engine, providing objects, behaviors and new features. For example, this includes the physics engines running in WebAssembly (Box2D or Jolt Physics for 3D). All the [community extensions are on this repository](https://github.com/GDevelopApp/GDevelop-extensions). |
